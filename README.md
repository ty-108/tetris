### A Tetris Game for my AP CS A Final Project

For the final project of my AP CS A class, I have coded up the game Tetris. It it programmed using mostly Java and some Processing for the drawing portion, and can be run in the Processing IDE. The tetris file is the main file, with the Tile, Piece, and TetrisGame files containing classes that make up the game.

Controls are the same as most Tetris variations: up to rotate, left/right/down to shift a block in that direction, and spacebar to insta-drop a block. Score, lines cleared, level, and high score are kept track of in the bottom right corner. The speed of the blocks dropping is based on a custom, time-based system, although a level-based system can also be implemented.

Have fun!
